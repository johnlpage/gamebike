To reverse engineer KICKR 

On an Androidn Phone enable developer mode
Then Turn on Bluetooth HCI Logging 
Turn Bluetooth off and on again to enable

Now interack with KICKR - Change power form 5 to 100 and back to 0

Turn BT Off
Turn BT Debug Off
<Do not turn BT ON>

attach to phone using SDK and adb

download data

```
adb bugreport filename
```

then unzip

```
unzip filename.zip
```

change to `FS/data/log/bt`

```
 tshark -xPVr btsnoop_hci.log > btsnoop.txt


 ```

 Now yoy can look for packets where your phone is writing
